v0.1.0

Thanks to Brad Morrey for partnering to help create qbrent (still needs a
better name), particularly with the UI and playing the dang game to see
how it was working while Brent was buried in thick blankets of code & design.

Thanks to Jesse Wilson for helpfully answering questions and licensing use
of his Hardquor project.  Thanks to Greg Doane for helping with various
questions regarding C++'s STL.
